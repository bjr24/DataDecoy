When DataDecoy is not set to \r\nmock an app's data, our LocationManger behaves identically to the original Android version. \r\nWhen DataDecoy is set to mock an app's data, our code distributes artificial location\r\ninformation to the specified apps.\r\n\r\nTeam Members\r\n---------\r\n* Guru Prasad Srinivasa\r\n* Denise Blady\r\n* Eric Lehner\r\n* Brian Rosenberg\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n---------\r\nThis image is Android JellyBean 4.1.1.
